Description:<br/>
Benchmarking a single-layer LSTM with:<br/>
- 320 hidden units<br/>
- 100 time steps<br/>
- batch size 64<br/>
- 1D input features, size 125<br/>
- output 10 classes<br/>

##### LSTMCell takes ONE input x_t at time t.<br/>

You need to loop time-steps in order to do one pass of backprop through time.
    
##### LSTM takes a SEQUENCE of inputs x_1,x_2,â€¦,x_T.

NO need to loop time-steps to do one pass of backprop through time.
